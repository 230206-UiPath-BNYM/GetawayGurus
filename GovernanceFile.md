# Governance document for the group:
### ~~~ _Teamwork makes the dream work_ ~~~

## Working on Git:

- At least one other person checks before merge made to main. <br>
- Make sure branches merging are up-to-date with main before each pull request is signed off. <br>
- Claim stuff in the project board by putting your GH profile name in the assignee dropdown.	<br>
- Make sure you're assigned something for each day and try to get it done by either day's end or the following day.	If you're having trouble, ask for help! <br>


## Daily Meetings:

- Discord/Teams to chat <br>
- Daily Stand-ups (but sitting down) regularly scheduled for 4:00 PM EST <br>
- Hang out in the Zoom break-out rooms (training zoom link) <br>
